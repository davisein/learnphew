# Learn PHysics by Editing Worlds (learnphew)

Physics are cool, they make the universe more awesome. The dislike of the physics curriculum in the school is justified because they don't teach physics.
They teach to use physics to get results.

Our proposal is Learn Phew, learn physics by editing worlds, by making the laws of physics tangible in the browser. We will love to have a full curriculum showing all the physics (well, at least the Newtonian ones) and allow the students to develop their own simple physics engine.

## Universal widgets
Wherever you need to show an explanation of a phenomenon, you can create a world, and open the link in any device (bricks not included)

## State
It is a prealpha (or earlier). It should work but it lacks of proper login and it has really annoying bugs. It was also an experiment to try [derby.js](http://derbyjs.com/).

But the examples in the editor work and it can be a funny codepen alternative to play with (it adds muu2d, a super simple canvas library).
